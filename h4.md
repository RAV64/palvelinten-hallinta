# x) Using VirtualBox on arm based MacOS 

TLDR: This doesn't work, [VirtualBox's Arm support isn't actually yet "Beta"](https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=107344#p525202) and it's name will be changed. Also since my need for Linux is running salt, which doesn't work on Arm, I don't believe getting a working Linux installation would bring me any value, except, having a working Linux installation.

## Environment

## Installing VirtualBox

- Download [Developer preview](https://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/7.0.8/VirtualBox-7.0.8_BETA4-156879-macOSArm64.dmg)
- Open the .dmg file
- Double click VirtualBox.pkg and follow installer instructions
- Open VirtualBox

## Installing Virtual Machine

- In VirtualBox click "New"
- Name your machine
- Select a folder for your machine
- Select an amd64 iso (I chose Debian/11)
- I chose not to skip unattended installation
- Press "Next"
- Select good username and a great password
- Press "Next"
- I left hardware memory allocation and amount of processors to my defaults (2048 MB / 1)
- Press "Next"
- Allocate a fair amount of VHD, can't go wrong with around 20-25GB, I chose 20GB
- Press "Next"
- Press "Finish"
- Wait for unattended installation to run in the background
- Succesfully fail to boot.. What.
- I received an error:

```
Failed to run unattended guest installation.

Callee RC:
NS_ERROR_ABORT (0X80004004)
```

- I repeated the steps above but checked the box about unattended installation
- Now when starting starting the machine I get a Debian window about install options and I chose the first one (Graphical install)
- Currently waiting with a black screen. I can't open the install output log.
- VirtualBox VM quit unexpectedly
- I tried to start it again and chose the install option this time.
- Same fate.
- Tested it with Arm64 version of debian with same steps, this didn't even reach the install screen
- Tested it with Amd64 ubuntu-22.04.2 which runs into a critical error.
- Ubuntu left logs in the vbox folder.
- I need to find what caused this crash, the error log is long.

- I scrolled to the bottom where I found a line:

Line 4946: `00:00:57.181503 Changing the VM state from 'DESTROYING' to 'TERMINATED'`

- I searched for the "DESTROYING" string since I guess something changed the state to that.

Line 4170: `00:00:57.174597 Changing the VM state from 'POWERING_OFF' to 'OFF'`

Line 4171: `00:00:57.177742 Changing the VM state from 'OFF' to 'DESTROYING'`

- Searching for the "POWERING_OFF" reason.. A cat and mouse game

Line 4098: `00:00:57.172685 Changing the VM state from 'GURU_MEDITATION' to 'POWERING_OFF'`

Line 1032: `00:00:39.380970 Changing the VM state from 'RUNNING' to 'GURU_MEDITATION'`

Line 1033: `00:00:39.381028 Console: Machine state changed to 'Stuck'`

- I can't make sense out of the nearby lines here.
- Checking the Debians for logs, Arm64 didn't even create logs and Amd64's logs didn't provide additional help compared to Ubuntu's logs
- Searching for the error above does bring up answers but the error seems generic and could be caused by many different issues.
- I tried to google for an answer and found a [askubuntu thread](https://askubuntu.com/a/1405125) which had a link for "A non-public (not on their main website) release of the arm64 Desktop version"
- I found this [forums.virtualbox thread](https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?t=108559), I guess this war of mine ends on a ceasefire.
- I tried to use the search feature on this forum which gave me this output `Sorry but you cannot use search at this time. Please try again in a few minutes.`
- Based on the earlier discoveries of neither salt or vagrant properly working even on my m1 mac, I dont believe getting a working arm linux could actually properly run stated software.
