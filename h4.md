# x) Using VirtualBox on arm based MacOS 

TLDR: This doesn't work, [VirtualBox's Arm support isn't actually yet "Beta"](https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=107344#p525202) and it's name will be changed. Also since my need for Linux is running salt, which doesn't work on Arm, I don't believe getting a working Linux installation would bring me any value, except, having a working Linux installation.

## Environment

<img width="214" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73443709/233990171-3a1b6fb0-aa7a-4918-b8c9-450b4a7e5d54.png">

## Installing VirtualBox

- Download [Developer preview](https://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/7.0.8/VirtualBox-7.0.8_BETA4-156879-macOSArm64.dmg)
- Open the .dmg file
- Double click VirtualBox.pkg and follow installer instructions
- Open VirtualBox

## Installing Virtual Machine

- In VirtualBox click "New"
- Name your machine
- Select a folder for your machine
- Select an amd64 iso (I chose Debian/11)
- I chose not to skip unattended installation
- Press "Next"
- Select good username and a great password
- Press "Next"
- I left hardware memory allocation and amount of processors to my defaults (2048 MB / 1)
- Press "Next"
- Allocate a fair amount of VHD, can't go wrong with around 20-25GB, I chose 20GB
- Press "Next"
- Press "Finish"
- Wait for unattended installation to run in the background
- Succesfully fail to boot.. What.
- I received an error:

```
Failed to run unattended guest installation.

Callee RC:
NS_ERROR_ABORT (0X80004004)
```

- I repeated the steps above but checked the box about unattended installation
- Now when starting starting the machine I get a Debian window about install options and I chose the first one (Graphical install)
- Currently waiting with a black screen. I can't open the install output log.
- VirtualBox VM quit unexpectedly
- I tried to start it again and chose the install option this time.
- Same fate.
- Tested it with Arm64 version of debian with same steps, this didn't even reach the install screen
- Tested it with Amd64 ubuntu-22.04.2 which runs into a critical error.
- Ubuntu left logs in the vbox folder.
- I need to find what caused this crash, the error log is long.

- I scrolled to the bottom where I found a line:

Line 4946: `00:00:57.181503 Changing the VM state from 'DESTROYING' to 'TERMINATED'`

- I searched for the "DESTROYING" string since I guess something changed the state to that.

Line 4170: `00:00:57.174597 Changing the VM state from 'POWERING_OFF' to 'OFF'`

Line 4171: `00:00:57.177742 Changing the VM state from 'OFF' to 'DESTROYING'`

- Searching for the "POWERING_OFF" reason.. A cat and mouse game

Line 4098: `00:00:57.172685 Changing the VM state from 'GURU_MEDITATION' to 'POWERING_OFF'`

Line 1032: `00:00:39.380970 Changing the VM state from 'RUNNING' to 'GURU_MEDITATION'`

Line 1033: `00:00:39.381028 Console: Machine state changed to 'Stuck'`

- I can't make sense out of the nearby lines here.
- Checking the Debians for logs, Arm64 didn't even create logs and Amd64's logs didn't provide additional help compared to Ubuntu's logs
- Searching for the error above does bring up answers but the error seems generic and could be caused by many different issues.
- I tried to google for an answer and found a [askubuntu thread](https://askubuntu.com/a/1405125) which had a link for "A non-public (not on their main website) release of the arm64 Desktop version"
- I found this [forums.virtualbox thread](https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?t=108559), I guess this war of mine ends on a ceasefire.
- I tried to use the search feature on this forum which gave me this output `Sorry but you cannot use search at this time. Please try again in a few minutes.`
- Based on the earlier discoveries of neither salt or vagrant properly working even on my m1 mac, I dont believe getting a working arm linux could actually properly run stated software.

# a) Hello script

I created a file shiner.sh in /tmp directory. This file has following content:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73443709/233999248-53a177dd-6610-4f8d-944f-692d580cec79.png)

Since its still just a regular file, I needed to update its permissions so anyone can execute it with `chmod ugo+x /tmp/shiner.sh`. This command adds execution priviledges (x) to UserGroupOther. Now this script can be ran with `/tmp/shiner.sh` 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73443709/233999875-7769ca05-58ee-4cae-a0f9-7291ecf0b5c7.png)

Next I copied the script to `/usr/local/bin`, checked that it works and confirmed that the priviledges are correct

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73443709/234000558-a2674363-0af3-4d96-afa6-89c7ffd5e9a0.png)

Next I copied the working shiner.sh script to `/srv/salt/` and created the following ..salt-script?.. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73443709/234002404-779fab94-30cc-473a-ae6f-d9f7f8850033.png)

I remember applying custom states was done with state.apply, so I used ctrl+r to search my command history for it. I found the right command and tried it with my new `.sls` file.

When executing `sudo salt '*' state.apply shiner_installer` I got this error:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73443709/234003646-58ebc376-fd02-4d73-b357-8223f495d748.png)

I modified the script to this:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73443709/234003936-f45cd082-7b29-4025-96f0-aacb48a47067.png)

And then the command succeeded.

I tried to test if the command worked with cmd.run:

Somethings wrong, I can feel it. I booted up another ssh connection to t001 minion and tried to execute the script, the script is found but permissions do not match..

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73443709/234004888-e8afcd83-1103-4868-8fd2-5152cff41bbf.png)

Some DuckDuckGoing..

- https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/ref/states/all/salt.states.file.html
- https://docs.saltproject.io/en/getstarted/config/files.html

I found out I need to set the "mode" parameter. I then used https://chmod-calculator.com/ to find out whats the number equilevant to `ugo+x`. I also chose to add read permissions so nobody has to run any scripts they can't inspect... The output code came to be `555`. 

Now my installer looks like this:

I applied the state again and tried to run the script with `sudo salt '*' cmd.run shiner.sh` and it worked!

# b) Cobra

I made sure python3 is installed:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73443709/234007942-16150c67-b874-4762-9872-e7fc80a305d9.png)

Next I made a script that prints the priviledges of itself. When getting env arguments the first argument is always the currently ran files path (atleast in python3, when called my user like this..)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73443709/234009783-7761bbe6-0316-4dc3-a330-4d97301a90a5.png)

Next I created a SALT_SCRIPT file that makes sure python3 is installed and copies the file with 555 priviledge.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73443709/234010638-e78ad97c-8ac4-4c58-8086-7233668e2eea.png)

All is good, only 1 change since python3 seems to be pre-installed

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73443709/234010912-da302065-4b3a-442c-8dc9-01da13b43f4e.png)

And a test:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73443709/234011366-1de2ad31-18de-4f66-bb29-3e596e469ab8.png)

Neat and cool! If the python script is modified to take the second argument and print its priviledges then it could be used to print the priviledges of other files passed to it.
