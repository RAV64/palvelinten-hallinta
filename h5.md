## [Control Windows with Salt](https://terokarvinen.com/2018/control-windows-with-salt/)

This writeup consists of thoughts and resolutions of using salt on windows. 
It handles installing salt on Linux, making & accepting windows as a salt minion 
and installing applications/running basic commands.

## [Windows -Johan Lindell](https://johanlindell.fi/palvelintenhallinta#h6)

Johan installs Salt-minion on Windows 10 and Salt-master on linux and connects them together,
next couple files are created from Masters side and results are checked on minion.

# a) Install Salt on Windows

Download [Salt](https://repo.saltproject.io/salt/py3/windows/latest/Salt-Minion-3006.0-Py3-AMD64-Setup.exe) on Windows.

I now created a Debian WSL with `wsl --install -d debian` and ran `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade`
Next I collected this machines ip address with `hostname -i` and proceeded with installing Master on Windows. 
When asked for Master IP or Hostname I put the address from the Master machine `yes -> next -> finish..`. 

I'll now install salt-master on Debian with `sudo apt install salt-master`. I now tried to accept the windows's key
with `sudo salt-key -A` but I got this error: `Error: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/var/lib/salt/pki/master'`
I checked my windows's processes and salt-minion is running. 

I've now put myself into a situation where I'm not even sure
Where to start debugging this process. I now ran `hostname -I` and test reinstalling salt-minion on windows but using these
new addresses. Neither of these addresses worked either. If I had to make assumptions, I would assume I'm not forwarding the
port salt-master uses on the wsl debian and my windows-minions calls can't reach it. I installed "lsof" on wsl debian but salt-master doesn't 
run as a process for me to find.

Now, reading the instructions I needed to follow again.. "Install Salt on Windows" I guess I'm actually done with this..

# b) Use salt locally on windows

# c) Hello windows
I used git bash to create salt directory on my desktop and created markdown file there:

I now created a saltscript file with following contents:

Jumping back to administrator powershell.. 

Uh oh..

Googling, I found a stackoverflow thread where someone pointed out I need to change salt-minions file-root. I think ill just figure it out and place my files there.

Running the command again tells me where the configurations are loaded:

In there I found the conf file:

I added this into that file:

Now applying the state again gives me this error:

I needed to fix my salt-script file aaaand TADA:

# d) Install a program

First I made sure Discord is not installed:

I created this file:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73443709/235450937-aebfb331-e31e-4c7e-977d-72ce568053ce.png)

And ran it:

And now I have discord:
