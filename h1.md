## Install Debian 11 with Vagrant

This step is normally done with `vagrant init debian/bullseye64` which doesn't work for me since im using arm based laptop.
I tried to use a "centos" box which also didn't work. These errors are from the error output visible in VirtualBox GUI which states the CPU isn't supported.
I tried to use a custom box which was said to work on a Apple M1 mac but same error persists. Might be a problem with VirtualBox?

Gave up with VirtualBox angle. Trying to use QEMU:
`brew install qemu`
`vagrant plugin install vagrant-qemu`
Changed vm.box to "perk/ubuntu-2204-arm64"
`vagrant up --provider qemu`

Received this warning:

```
==> tmaster: Warning! The QEMU provider doesn't support any of the Vagrant
==> tmaster: high-level network configurations (`config.vm.network`). They
==> tmaster: will be silently ignored.
```

And then these Errors for each of 3 machines:

```
An error occurred while executing the action on the 't001'
machine. Please handle this error then try again:

Vagrant cannot forward the specified ports on this VM, since they
would collide with some other application that is already listening
on these ports. The forwarded port to 50022 is already in use
on the host machine.

To fix this, modify your current project's Vagrantfile to use another
port. Example, where '1234' would be replaced by a unique host port:

  config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 22, host: 1234

Sometimes, Vagrant will attempt to auto-correct this for you. In this
case, Vagrant was unable to. This is usually because the guest machine
is in a state which doesn't allow modifying port forwarding. You could
try 'vagrant reload' (equivalent of running a halt followed by an up)
so vagrant can attempt to auto-correct this upon booting. Be warned
that any unsaved work might be lost.
```

I don't know how to fix this issue, im losing it and moving to intel based computer.

I installed VirtualBox & Vagrant on Windows 10, copied the Vagrantfile from article above and ran `vagrant up`.
Painless process :)

Connect to master and accept minion's keys.

`vagrant ssh tmaster`
`sudo salt-key -A`

Test connections:
`sudo salt '*' cmd.run "echo yes"`
Both minions replied with "yes".
